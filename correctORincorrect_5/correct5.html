                                        Explanation of the Answer: <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The program starts off with the user entering the value 7 on Line 8 and assigning numElements to it, therefore the array must <br>
                                        have a fixed value of 7 elements assigned to it, with indexes from 0-6. This rules out the answer of index 8. Lines 11-14 initiates a <br>
                                        for loop which takes 7 integer inputs from the user into the array. Lines 16-18 will show another for loop, but this time it <br>
                                        will reverse the order of array elements of which the user entered. The final for loop, shown in Lines 23-28 will then take the updated <br>
                                        reversed order of the array list. Starting with a value of 0, maxIndexValue will iterate through the array and for each element, if <br>
                                        it is greater than the previous maxValue, then it will update maxValue with the current element. Since the greatest element in the list <br>
                                        is 9, at index 1, maxIndexValue will be updated with 1, and will therefore give the answer of index 1 to the question.
